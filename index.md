# Cognition in Collectives Lab Manual

Welcome to our lab! This manual will orient you to our culture and research practices. The contents will give you a sense of what you can expect from working in the lab, as well as what we expect of you.


## Who we are

We a group of researchers interested in how psychologically grounded micro-processes give rise to large scale social outcomes. The topics we study include (but are not limited to) the dynamics involved in the formation of collective memories, alignment of collective emotions in social networks, and the synchronization of collective beliefs. We explore these topics through a variety of methods, including survey research, lab experiments, computational models, and social network analysis.

As a community, we are committed to challenging and supporting each other. We strive towards open and reproducible science and to disseminate insights from our work beyond the confines of our field. Weâ€™re lucky to be exploring the questions we love, and we have fun doing it!
